## Key Features of the Analysis

- Comparative analysis of Hindi, Punjabi, and English music trends
- Temporal analysis from 1990s to 2020s
- Multiple visualization types (line charts, bar charts, heatmaps)
- Statistical correlation analysis
- Sentiment analysis framework
- Interactive plotting capabilities

## Libraries Used

The analysis leverages several R packages:
- `ggplot2` for static visualizations
- `dplyr` for data manipulation
- `tidyverse` for data science workflows
- `corrplot` for correlation matrices
- `plotly` for interactive visualizations
- And several others as detailed in the main documentation

## Expected Outputs

When you run the full analysis, you will generate:
1. Multiple visualizations saved as image files
2. A comprehensive dataset in CSV format
3. Statistical summaries and trend analyses
4. Correlation matrices and significance tests
